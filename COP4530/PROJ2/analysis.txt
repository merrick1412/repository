empty() - O(1)
the runtime will always be 1,
 because there will only be 1 operation performed here. (a comparison operator on size)
which means the time it takes to make this check will remain the same.

erase(iterator itr) - O(n)
depending on the size of the distance the for loop has to navigate, n, it can only take n time.
there is no case where it will take longer than n time, because that is the boundaries of the loop
the only other case would be O(1), which is negligible compared to O(n).

pop_back() - O(1)
pop back will only perform one operation, no matter the size. Either a cout, or a decrement.
